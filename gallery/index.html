    <h1>Press Fit Lamp</h1>
    <h4>by Joana Espinoza</h4>
    <img src=".IMG_0285_(1).jpeg" width="500" />
    <p> Curated for MAT 111 Prototype Fabricat Class. Throughout the course I found enjoyement in creating objects with gemoetric shapes and patterns. 
    This press fit lamp was easy to make and assemble so the main focus was on the design. Inspiration was drawn from Bohemain patterns and Wooden lamps I found 
    in State St. </p>

    <img src=".IMG_2526.jpeg" width="500" />
    <p> A design that was also created for MAT 111 Prototype Fabricate Class. One of my biggest goals was to fabricate something fashion related within this course. My fascination with 
    jewelery and accessories inspired the creation of this choker and I utilized it to curate meaningful art for my styling portfolio. </p>
